Can hearts sing?
Können Herzen singen?

Can a heart break?
Kann ein Herz zerspringen?

Can hearts be pure?
Können Herzen rein sein?

Can a heart be made of stone?
Kann ein Herz aus Stein sein?
They want my heart in the right place
Sie wollen mein Herz am rechten Fleck

But then I look down
Doch seh' ich dann nach unten weg
Then it hits left
Dann schlägt es links
